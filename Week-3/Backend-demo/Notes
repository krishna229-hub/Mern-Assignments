Execute and then execute then only it will Execute like that we can use the middle bias for every request like this or from specific request in this way now tell me
To create you That means finally I do not want these too many ways to execute for every family request it is where you get users middleware 2 for create users F dot a come to the F dot this one right so here I want to execute I want to come everywhere one S I may need to write like this or just the name of the function because you should not if you write like this you are calling this But we need to make the express to call when it is required that's why we should supply only the name of the middleware dont attack this pair of functions in the state you should allow the express to call when it requires next middleware 2 I want to call only during creation of the user let us cheque now let me get our users only within one execute it correct now let me create a post now midi by two only executive hope you are completely free with the answer problem anyways because we use this midi base almost every day when we are working with the rest eighteen implementation in the back end 
Call router method or into the capital You have to call the router method and R is capital what this router method of this express application will do is we could not create the complete express application instead it will create a small mini express application and returns now instead of using the variable name app let us make it more meaningfully like user app but because app variable reserved for holding the express application that internally content the http server but this mini express application do not have the http server instead of that that is why we can call it as mini express application ok so now I can replace all these apps with this viewer right so now what happened here in the apis we can create the many express application what is the difference between actual express application and many express application actual express application contains the http server but the Dini Express application contains only the http method handling mechanism
